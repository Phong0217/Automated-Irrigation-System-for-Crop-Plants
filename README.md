# Automated Irrigation System for Crop Plants

## Introduction
The Automated Irrigation System for Crop Plants is a self-regulating irrigation system designed to control and provide the appropriate amount of water for crops. Utilizing microcontrollers and sensors, this system optimizes irrigation, delivering the right amount of water needed to sustain the optimal growth and productivity of crops.

## Features
1. **Soil Moisture Measurement:** Utilizes a soil moisture sensor to measure the current moisture level in the soil.
2. **Rainfall Measurement:** Rain sensor determines recent rainfall to adjust the irrigation schedule.
3. **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) Measurement:** TDS sensor measures the mineral content in water, aiding decisions on the quality of irrigation water.
4. **Pump Control:** The system controls the water pump based on data collected from sensors.
5. **Information Display:** Creates a simple web interface to display information about water levels, rainfall, TDS, and irrigation status.

## Usage
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect sensors (soil moisture, rain, TDS) and the water pump to the microcontroller (Arduino, STM32, or a similar platform).
2. **Run the Software:** Flash the code onto the microcontroller and start the system.
3. **Access the Web Interface:** Use a web browser to access the web interface to monitor and control crop irrigation.

## Technical Specifications
- **Programming Languages:** C Linx (using LABVIEW).
- **Microcontroller Platforms:** Arduino.
- **Communication:** I2C (for sensors), UART.
